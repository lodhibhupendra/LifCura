# Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
Emails are being sent successfully from the server (confirmed by message IDs) but not being received at `lodhibhupendra172@gmail.com`.

## ✅ Confirmed Working
- ✅ SMTP connection to Brevo
- ✅ Email sending (message IDs generated)
- ✅ Server logs show successful delivery
- ✅ No server-side errors

## 🔍 Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Check Gmail Spam/Junk Folder**
- Open Gmail → Go to "Spam" folder
- Search for "LifCura" or "932ea5002@smtp-brevo.com"
- If found, mark as "Not Spam"

### 2. **Check Gmail Filters**
- Gmail Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses
- Look for any filters blocking emails from Brevo domain

### 3. **Check Gmail "All Mail"**
- Go to "All Mail" folder in Gmail
- Search for subject: "[LifCura Contact]"

### 4. **Gmail Search**
Try these searches in Gmail:
```
from:932ea5002@smtp-brevo.com
subject:"LifCura Contact"
"LifCura Contact Form"
```

### 5. **Brevo Domain Reputation**
Gmail might be blocking emails from Brevo's shared IP. This is common with free SMTP services.

## 🛠️ Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Gmail SMTP (Recommended)
Instead of Brevo, use Gmail's SMTP with an App Password:

1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail
2. Generate App Password: Google Account → Security → App passwords
3. Update SMTP settings:
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=lodhibhupendra172@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
   ```

### Option 2: Use Different Email Service
- SendGrid (more reliable delivery)
- Mailgun
- Amazon SES

### Option 3: Test with Different Recipient
Try sending to a different email address to confirm delivery works:
- Yahoo Mail
- Outlook
- Another Gmail account

## 🧪 Current Test Results
```
Latest Test Email:
- Subject: "URGENT: Check Spam Folder - LifCura Test Email"
- Status: ✅ Sent Successfully
- Message ID: Generated (check server logs)
- Recipient: lodhibhupendra172@gmail.com
```

## 📞 Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Check spam folder and Gmail search
2. **Short-term**: Switch to Gmail SMTP for better delivery
3. **Long-term**: Consider professional email service for production

## 🔧 Gmail SMTP Configuration (Recommended Fix)
```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: "lodhibhupendra172@gmail.com",
    pass: "your_gmail_app_password", // Generate from Google Account settings
  },
});
```

This will ensure emails are delivered directly from your Gmail account, avoiding spam filters.
